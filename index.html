      <h2>so... where are you? what is this? and who am I</h2>
      <p>I’m Renee. I'm a creator at heart and in all facets of my life.<br>
        At work this looks like building more efficient systems and processes for our internal team.<br>
        But in my own time I like to get my hands dirty, painting, making pottery and most recently making jewellery.<br>
        <br>
        This - Unearthly Entity is an effort to be more authentic and vulnerable - intentionally taking myself out of my comfort zone and sharing this part of myself with you.<br>
        (and to hold myself accountable to continue doing this)And I'm hopelessly hopeful that we'll be able to make the world a slightly more homely place.‍<br>
        <br>
        I'm a person, living in Melbourne & passionate about learning, living and working towards a slightly better world..<br></p>
